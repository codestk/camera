# AGENTS.md â€” Project Instructions for Codex

## Project Scope

- This project contains **multiple `.py` files**, but only **one file is active**:
  - `cameraGemeni copy  camera  gemeni    Best Ui Gemeni.py`
- **All other Python files are backups**. Do **not** edit, refactor, or suggest changes to them.

## AI Editing Rules

- Always open and modify **only the main file** listed above.
- If the user asks for changes:
  - Apply them inside the main file.
  - Ignore or skip other files, even if they look similar.
- When showing code snippets:
  - Use the exact file name in examples.
  - Make clear that other backup files are out of scope.

## Additional Notes

- Keep the file runnable as a standalone PyQt6 + OpenCV app.
- Preserve UI structure and existing logic.
- Focus on fixing bugs, improving readability, and performance inside this file only.
